# DSA_1_UIU
Hey, folks! 

This repository will be immensely helpful if you are taking a **Data Structure and Algorithm-I** course or practicing **DSA-1 topics**. This brief article is here to help you become familiar with its contents.


## How This Repository Can Help You

- **Quick Reference:** The repository can serve as a quick reference guide. You can easily find relevant code for DSA topics, saving time on online resource searches.
- You will know which problems I solved before any of my exams; this will help you get an idea about the exam.
- **You are getting more understandable code.**
- **Coding Practice:** You can use the code for coding practice. You can modify and experiment with the code to reinforce your understanding of DSA topics.
- **Transition to C++:** It will help you transition from C to C++; this code can be an excellent resource to help you get up to speed with the language.


## Directory Contents
First of all, you have seen 3 folders.
 - **Class(LAB)**
   
    It is not necessary for you. [Contains some lab codes]
 - **DSA_LAB_EXAM_Question_Solve**

   Hopefully, you can determine the contents of the next folder from its name (DSA_LAB_EXAM_Question_Solve).
 - **[DSA_TOPICS](https://github.com/TashinParvez/DSA_1_UIU/tree/main/DSA_TOPICS)**

    You will find every topic code with accompanying comments with it.

## Used Shortcuts
If you are reading my code for the first time maybe you will find some unknown little shortcuts (Predefined), I use in my every code, so to get similar with it you just need to see the below codes. It's very simple, you can also use these tricks on your code to write code faster. All codes are written in C++. Don't worry if you don't know this language if you know C Programming that will be enough for you to understand every topic. 

- sometimes you will find these 2 lines at the beginning of my code
```bash
  //        ****************  Author:  Tashin.Parvez       *************************\
  //        ****************  Updated:    18-08-23     *************************\
```
   this line came when I used my code template which is saved on my device.
- The `include bits/stdc++.h` isÂ a header file that we use in our code to include all the standard libraries[C++].
- **CRACKED** I use this instead of `return 0;`
   
   [Nothing but this my code different from others, you can say it's my signature]
- `using namespace std;`
In **C++**, we use it to make our code shorter and easier to read. It lets us use standard C++ functions and objects without having to type `std::` before each one. It's like a shortcut that saves us time and makes our code cleaner.

- I write **null** instead of writing `NULL`. [Why? Well, when writing code quickly, I sometimes forget to use all capital letters for "NULL" To avoid segmentation errors I use null and it's predefined.]
